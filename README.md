## How It Works
- **Homepage (`index.html`):** Welcomes users and provides quick links to other sections.
- **Gallery (`gallery.html`):** Displays a grid of travel images. Clicking an image opens a modal with navigation to view other images.
- **Blog (`blog.html`):** Contains travel articles and tips.
- **About (`about.html`):** Information about the agency or website purpose.
- **Contact (`contact.html`):** Form for users to send messages or inquiries.
- **JavaScript (`js/script.js`):** Handles gallery modal functionality and navigation bar interactions.
- **CSS:** All styling is managed in the `css/` folder, with separate files for normalization, utilities, main styles, and responsive adjustments.
